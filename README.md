# PCA-dimensionality-reduction
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the Iris dataset, which features measurements of three iris species. By reducing the dataset's dimensionality from four to two dimensions. The resulting plot clearly illustrates the separation of Iris Setosa from the other species, enhancing data interpretation.
